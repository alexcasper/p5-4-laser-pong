### P5.JS Template Instructions
Welcome to the Template P5 Repo, used to make P5 work in [repl.it](../).
Run should bring up a simple sketch.
To edit the sketch, see [sketch.js](./emptyp5#sketch.js)

You can find the reference, with the descriptions of basic P5 functions, [here](https://p5js.org/reference/)
You can also find documentation for JavaScript [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript)
There is an excellent web editor [here](https://editor.p5js.org/) - this was only made to facilitate multiplayer!
 
[index.html](./emptyp5#index.html) only needs to be changed to add a title, or instructions.
If you are coming across this randomly, you may want to edit the index.html to include the latest version of P5, found [here](https://p5js.org/get-started/#settingUp).
